## Patterns To Reuse
- Clear outcome-led hero framing before product mechanics.
- Immediate trust framing near the top (proof language, reliability cues, and buyer confidence signals).
- Short sections with one dominant message each, instead of long blended paragraphs.
- Action-forward CTAs that stay specific to the buyer journey (`book demo`, `get started`, `talk to sales`).
- Concrete process framing (`how it works`) using simple step progression.
- Category vocabulary that sounds operational, not hype-driven (`risk`, `verification`, `compliance`, `evidence`).

## Patterns To Avoid
- Generic AI copy without a hiring outcome.
- Overcrowded hero blocks with too many conflicting CTAs.
- Vague promises that imply autonomous hiring decisions.
- Hiding legal limitations in tiny footer-only copy.
- Dense walls of text without visual grouping.

## Target Information Architecture
1. Hero: resume-risk value proposition + primary CTA.
2. Proof strip: speed, evidence trace, and workflow confidence.
3. Problem framing: why fast hiring misses fake claims.
4. Verification coverage: what signals are validated.
5. Process steps: how the screening cycle runs.
6. Decision brief outcomes: what hiring teams receive.
7. Lead form CTA block: conversion with clear form path.
8. Legal disclaimer: explicit human-in-the-loop responsibility.

## Concrete Decisions (Section-Mapped)
1. Hero: use a risk-screening badge and direct headline about wasted interview cycles; no abstract mission statement.
2. Hero CTA: primary CTA anchors to lead form, secondary CTA anchors to process section.
3. Hero support panel: include a compact signal matrix so users understand evidence scope before form interaction.
4. Proof strip: show concise operational claims (`3-step review cycle`, `source-backed trace`) to reduce ambiguity.
5. Problem section: explicitly call out fake employers, inflated titles, and synthetic personas as screening risks.
6. Verification section: present three distinct validation domains (employment continuity, credential plausibility, identity/location clues).
7. How-it-works section: use ordered steps that match recruiter workflow cadence from intake to decision.
8. Decision-brief section: state deliverables as hiring artifacts (claim verdicts, source trail, recommended next action).
9. Form section: keep form fields minimal and role-focused to reduce friction while preserving qualification context.
10. Legal section: keep disclaimer visible in-body and footer (`screening assistance only`, final decisions by humans).

## Copy Guardrails
- Keep copy conversion-focused and operational.
- Use evidence language (`source-backed`, `confidence`, `trace`) instead of model-centric language.
- Do not imply final hiring automation.
- Preserve explicit legal disclaimer: Bullshit or Fit provides screening support, not final employment decisions.
- Prefer short, concrete sentences over marketing abstraction.

## Visual Direction
- Warm editorial base with higher-contrast action accents (avoid generic dark SaaS clone look).
- Strong typography hierarchy with compact heading rhythm.
- Distinct card groupings for process and signal coverage.
- Minimal but meaningful motion (staggered reveal only), with reduced-motion fallback.
- Mobile-first resilience: form controls and CTAs must stay full-width and easy to target below 700px.
